## What does this app do?

The Mipow app uses Bluetooth Low Energy to connect with a variety of Mipow lights. 

To make sure the lights turn on and off quickly the connection will not be closed. However, a polling mechanism has been implemented as well to synchronize the colors of the lights with Homey and quickly reconnect in case a light has been manually turned off.

Each type of Mipow device can be identified by a service UUID which it exposes in the advertisement. The lights are being set by writing to the color characteristic `0000fffc00001000800000805f9b34fb` or to the animation characteristic `0000fffb00001000800000805f9b34fb`.
